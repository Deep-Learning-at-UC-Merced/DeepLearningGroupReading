# UCM Applied Math Deep Learning Group (DLG)
This repo hosts the material and references covered in the DLG learning group in Fall 2021. This `README` will be updated regularly before each meeting, so please check back for more information and resources. Contributions to this repo will also be greatly appreciated, so please feel free to fork and pull request with any updates you find necessary. ***Please star ⭐️ the repository for staying tuned with the updates***

## General Information
The main objective of the learning group is to dive deeper into fundamentals of Machine Learning (Deep Learning in particular) through a mathematical lens. This group will provide a forum for graduate students, postdocs and faculty interested in Deep Learning to learn about the fundamentals and advances in the field while fostering broader discussions and collaborations. This group is organized by [Ali Heydari](https://www.ali-heydari.com/about). 
 
##### Meeting times:
 
The group will meet Fridays from 11:00am-12:30pm in ACS 362B, beginning September 3rd. 
 
##### Meeting format:
 
The first half hour of the sessions will be dedicated to reading, followed by discussions of the topics. This format is intended to provide a dedicated time for participants to read about the specific topics during each session, so that all can engage in fruitful discussions and contribute to the group’s collective learning. Given the time constraints however, *participants are expected to have a working knowledge of machine learning and other relevant prerequisites*. 
 
#### Meeting Meta Topics:
 
Given the broad range of topics and the short amount of time, we would like to tailor each session to address the interest of the audience in the following meta topics: 
 
1. Universal Approximation Theorem
1. Evaluation of ML/DL Models
1. Optimization in Deep Learning
1. Deep Learning in Computer Vision
1. Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing

## Learning Resources 
Here we provide a list of hand-picked resources for each of the meeting sessions, in addition to references for pre-requisites needed before attending the session.
